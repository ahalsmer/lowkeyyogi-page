<h3 id="hatha-video-commentary">A Slow, Relaxing Practice</h3>
<p id="hatha-video-commentary">A slower-paced Hatha practice allows a deeper exploration of each pose and more focused breathing. Sometimes called the "moving meditation," Hatha yoga also helps improve flexibility and muscle health. Studies show that Hatha yoga reduces stress and depression symptoms while improving muscle flexibility, joint flexibility, core muscle strength, and balance.</p>
        <p id="vinyasa-video-commentary">
          A meditative Hatha yoga would be a good choice for those who want to focus on their core strength or posture.

          <h3 id="video-commentary-title">A Fun, Challenging Flow</h3>
        <p id="video-commentary">A more challenging Vinyasa flow tends to improve energy levels while lowering stress levels. The faster pace of your flow into different poses helps you to build muscle strength and endurance to boot. Vinyasa yoga research has shown a reduction in stress and anxiety levels and an improvement in stability and balance.</p>
        <p id="video-commentary">
          A strength-building Vinyasa practice is a great choice if you want to get a cardio and strength training workout during your yoga session, while improving overall athleticism.
